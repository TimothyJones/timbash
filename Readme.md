# timbash - useful bash functions

Here are some bash functions I find myself including often.

## Script reference:

* `bin/aws-mac.sh`: Exposes the AWS auth environment variables to mac applications

## Logging example usage:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -eu

# Source the logging script
. `cd $(dirname "$0"); pwd`/lib/lib-logging.sh

log "Start of script"
warn "Oh! Look!"
error "Something went wrong"

banner "Don't worry!"

fail_banner "panic"

success_banner "No, don't panic"
```
Output:
